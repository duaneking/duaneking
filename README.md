# For Hiring Managers
* I'm available, but I'm looking to have the stability to support a family.
* Please do not contact me about your electronic currency startup. I'm sick of getting contacted by groups of frat boys that do not undertand the tech, or about hash collisions.

# For Cyptographers
* The words "plumless" and "buckeroo" both have the same crc32 hash, and will create a hash collision.
* Web3 is a series of hash collisions, at "web scale".

# For Recruiters

Dear Recruiter,
  Thank you for your interest in my skills and services.  I'm currently on the market because my prior employer was not what I was told.

I'm not interested in non-FTE roles. Do not ask.

I'm not interested in relocation of any kind.   Do not ask me to relocate.

I'm not interested in working non-PST hours.  Do not ask me to timeshift.

I'm not interested in working over 45 hours a week. The World Health Organization says working too too many hours a week is harmful to my health.

I do NOT have a gmail.

If for some reason you feel that you have an opportunity that I would be interested in please consider the following:
* I specialize in:

    * NoSQL Databases: Redis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, others.
* I do *NOT* do front-end development or graphic design.  Asking me to do them is explicitly unprofessional of you. Hire A Real Artist.
* My preferred platforms are Linux, Windows, Mac, AWS, Azure, but I have code helping to power Azure from my time at MS.
* My preferred languages are Python, C#, Rust, C, Go, but I'm a language agnostic software developer and would rather focus on using the right tool for the job.

* I am NOT interested in low paying or short term contract work at this time. I'm activly trying to stay out of consulting.
* I live in a state where a recruiter misrepresenting a job is a crime per https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.44.050
* I consider anybody asking me to either relocate or time shift to a non-PST time zone be acting criminally malicius and hostile under my states laws.
