### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on many projects I dont want to talk about here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can daily, and have been for decades because I love to learn and consider a day without learning something new to be wasted.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ways to make the world better, while sharing in the success I create for others.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning to be a better human, engineer, and friend.
- 💬 Ask me about my desire to get out of consulting and contracting permanently.
- 📫 How to reach me? Probably [twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.github.com%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&region=follow_link&screen_name=honestduane&tw_p=followbutton)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Most programming languages use the same patterns to define their internals.  <!-- Ask me what they are. -->
