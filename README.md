## Skills

- Distributed Systems
- Rest/GraphQL and Web API Architecture.

# For Hiring Managers
* I'm not really willing to consider your temp contract role because I activly want to invest in being on a team I can be with for the long term over the forseeable future.  I'm looking for that "work home" people talk about, that team of people you look firward to seeing at work. I'm sick of contracting and consulting because it makes me feel like a temperary person who isnt being productive in his own goals, and so if I do it again it will be to survive, not because I want it as my priority. If you want to hire me, you have to make me your employee, or you need to pay me above and beyond what your employees get by a multiple on a temperary basis in return for the added risk of the contract being temperary employment that by its very nature, is more risky and costly for me as well as makes getting work in the future harder because hiring managers like you like to use contracts as an excuse not to hire somebody they are scared knows more than they do. So it really has to be worth the expense to me. Its not worth my time to accept a contract role that pays less than I can make as a consultant making much more than an employee just because you want the benifits of a temperary consultant but you dont want to treat them fairly by paying them a market wage in return for the added risk, so if you want me on a contract you are going to pay above and beyond for the privledge and if $300/hour is too expensive then stop asking, please. Can I make that in consulting? Yeah, probably. But I'd rather be happy.
* I'm 100% remote and do not look at or consider roles that require travel or commute to an office.
  - If you expect any developer to come into an office, then you have unrealistic expectations.
* Please do not contact me about your electronic currency startup.
  - I'm sick of getting contacted by groups of frat boys that do not undertand the tech.
  - I'm sick of people not understanding what hash collisions are.
  - I'm sick of people running scams and abusing others due to the high technical bar required to understand that its a scam.
  - Web3 is a scam. Any system that doesnt allow good actors to make things right is a trap. http://concerned.tech

# For Cyptographers
* The words "plumless" and "buckeroo" both have the same crc32 hash, and will create a hash collision.
* Web3 is a series of hash collisions, at "web scale", designed to trick people with FOMO due to the high technical bar required to understand that its a scam.

# For Recruiters
Dear Recruiter,
  Thank you for your interest in my skills and services.

I'm not interested in contract roles of any kind. Do not ask.

I'm not interested in a commute or going to an office. Do not ask me to commute or travel.

I'm not interested in relocation of any kind.  Do not ask me to relocate.

I'm not interested in working non-PST hours.  Do not ask me to timeshift.

I'm not interested in working over 45 hours a week. The World Health Organization says working too too many hours a week is harmful to my health.

I do NOT have a gmail.

If for some reason you feel that you have an opportunity that I would be interested in anyway (and you do, every damn day) please consider the following:
* I specialize in:
    * Leading Software Development Teams
    * Helping Teams Level Up
    * Helping Companies grow enginering orgs the right way as they scale.
    * Helping Companies optimize and scale through business value engine optimization.
    * Software Development/Writing Code
    * Distributed Systems Architecture and Design
    * REST API Development
    * Cloud Computing: AWS, Azure, others.
    * Continuous Delivery piplines/Helping teams gain traction.
    * Relational Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, etc.
    * NoSQL Databases: Redis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, others.
* I do *NOT* do front-end development or graphic design.  Asking me to do them is explicitly unprofessional of you. Hire A Real Artist and give them money for food and rent that they can choose to spend on art supplies instead.
* My preferred platforms are Linux, Windows, Mac, AWS, Azure, but I have code helping to power Azure from my time at MS.
* My preferred languages are Python, C#, Rust, C, Java, Go, but I'm a language agnostic software developer and would rather focus on using the right tool for the job.
* I am a United States Citizen, and am *NOT* interested in working for any company that does not legitimatly have an american presence in the state of WA.
* My name (Duane) is Irish, but it often confuses people as I'm told it sounds asian and so that may be why I get so many people calling me and not speaking english.  I only understand english and software fluently.  I hang up on people who refuse to speak english after I interupt them and tell them I only speak english.  After all, a phone is used to communicate, and if a person doesn't want to communicate in a language that I understand, then they don't want to communicate, so it seems fair to hang up on them.
* I only work 100% remote from my home in Seattle, WA, as I'm actively trying to protect people in my life who have compramised immune systems from Covid19.
* I live in a state where a recruiter misrepresenting a job is a crime per https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.44.050 and I hate that I have to link that here because it shows you the sort of people I am forced to deal with daily.
* I consider anybody asking me to either relocate or time shift to a non-PST time zone be acting criminally malicius and hostile under my states laws.
