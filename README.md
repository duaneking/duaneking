# For Hiring Managers
* I'm not willing to consider your temp contract role.  I'm out of contracting and consulting. If you want to hire me, you have to make me your employee.
* I'm 100% remote and do not look at or consider roles that require travel or commute to an office.

# For Cyptographers
* The words "plumless" and "buckeroo" both have the same crc32 hash, and will create a hash collision.
* Web3 is a series of hash collisions, at "web scale", designed to trick people with FOMO due to the high technical bar required to understand that its a scam.

# For Recruiters
Dear Recruiter,

I'm not interested in working over 45 hours a week. The World Health Organization says working too too many hours a week is harmful to my health.

I do NOT have a gmail.

If for some reason you feel that you have an opportunity that I would be interested in please consider the following:
* I specialize in:
    * Leading Software Development Teams

    * NoSQL Databases: Redis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, others.
* I do *NOT* do front-end development or graphic design.  Asking me to do them is explicitly unprofessional of you. Hire A Real Artist.
* My preferred platforms are Linux, Windows, Mac, AWS, Azure, but I have code helping to power Azure from my time at MS.
* My preferred languages are Python, C#, Rust, C, Java, Go, but I'm a language agnostic software developer and would rather focus on using the right tool for the job.
* I am a United States Citizen, and am *NOT* interested in working for any company that does not legitimatly have an american presence in the state of WA.
* My name (Duane) is Irish, but often confuses people.  I only understand english and software fluently.  I hang up on people who refuse to speak english.
* I only work 100% remote from my home in Seattle, WA, as I'm actively trying to protect people in my life who have compramised immune systems from Covid19.
* I live in a state where a recruiter misrepresenting a job is a crime per https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.44.050 and I hate that I have to link that here because it shows you the sort of people I am forced to deal with daily.
* I consider anybody asking me to either relocate or time shift to a non-PST time zone be acting criminally malicius and hostile under my states laws.
